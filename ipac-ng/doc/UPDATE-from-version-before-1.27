UPDATING a postgres database from ipac-ng before version 1.27
=============================================================


With version 1.27 the postgres database structure has been changed 
a little. There is now one more field named 'hostname'.

To do the changes manually run the postgres interactive terminal
  psql -U ipac ipac

There enter the following commands listed

  DROP INDEX "logs_rule";
  DROP INDEX "logs_rule_time";
  DROP INDEX "logs_time";
  alter table logs add hostname character varying(32);
  update logs SET hostname = 'router';
  CREATE  INDEX "logs_rule" ON "logs" ("rule_name");
  CREATE  UNIQUE INDEX "logs_rule_time" ON "logs" ("rule_name", "that_time");
  CREATE  INDEX "logs_time" ON "logs" ("that_time");

Replace 'router' with the hostname of your host. Take into account to increase 
the size of the hostname field from 32 to something bigger if your host's
hostname is longer than 31 characters. Check the output of the "hostname" command.

It might also be good to install phpPgAdmin - http://phppgadmin.sourceforge.net/
as it is quite a good webfrontend to your postgres database.
