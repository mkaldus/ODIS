BUILDING ipac-ng with iptables source code
==========================================


With version 1.34 fetchipac program became to use iptables shared
libraries: libxtables.so and libiptc.so (or libip4tc.so). So, these
libraries must exist in your system if you are building ipac-ng with
default configuration options.

If your Linux distribution doesn't provide these libraries there
is a way to compile iptables source code into fetchipac program.
How to do it?

Firstly, you will need to obtain iptables source package. The preferred
origin of this package is your Linux distribution, acceptable origin is
http://www.netfilter.org, the home page of iptables project. Note,
iptables source package version must match version of iptables binaries
installed in your system.

Unpack obtained iptables source package to some directory and configure it
(run ./configure script in that directory). You will need at least read
access to this directory while building ipac-ng.

Go to ipac-ng source tree root, and run configure script with following
option:
	./configure --with-iptables-src=DIR
where DIR is directory where you unpacked iptables sources.

Compile and install ipac-ng as usual:
	make
	sudo make install

Note, you will need to recompile and reinstall ipac-ng every time after
changing iptables version installed in your system.
