Ok, here you go:

Download and install SQLite from http://sqlite.org/, eg. get an RPM from 
http://sqlite.org/download.html

Configure, compile and install ipac-ng-1.30.

The output of configure should look like this:
   # ./configure
   checking for gcc... gcc
   ...
   checking sqlite.h usability... yes
   checking sqlite.h presence... yes
   ...
   checking for available storage methods... gdbm mysql sqlite plain-file postgre
   ...

In /etc/ipac.conf set
   storage = sqlite
   db name = ipac

Then run
   fetchipac -S
to set up the iptables rules and run
   fetchipac
to fetch the data and store them in the database. The first call to fetchipac 
without parameters should print "ipac-ng[sqlite]: creating logs table" which 
basically means that the database file named ipac.db (=parameter 'db name' in 
ipac.conf) got created at /var/lib/ipac.

To access this database use the sqlite utility like this:
   # sqlite /var/lib/ipac/ipac.db
   SQLite version 2.8.14
   Enter ".help" for instructions

   sqlite> select * from logs;
   TOTAL in|0|0|1092409104|somehost
   TOTAL in|0|0|1092409106|somehost

   sqlite> delete from logs where that_time=1092409104;
   sqlite> select * from logs;
   TOTAL in|0|0|1092409106|somehost

   sqlite>

See doc/postgres-db.sql for how the database table logs is defined.
