Q: How can I test ipacsum by running if from the source directory without 
   installing it in the system?

A: Run the following configure command (add other options if needed):

     ./configure --prefix=${PWD%/*} --sbindir='${exec_prefix}'/${PWD##*/} --with-confdir=${PWD}/ipac-ng
     mkdir ipac-ng
     make

   Don't forget to put the config files in ./ipac-ng not in /etc/ipac-ng!

   You can now run fetchipac and ipacsum by calling them via 
   "./fetchipac" and "./ipacsum" respectively.

Q: How can I test a new version of ipacsum without overwriting the currently 
   installed version? Meaning I want to run it from the source directory but 
   want to use the configuration files of the currently installed version.

A: Run the following configure command (add other options if needed):

     ./configure --prefix=${PWD%/*} --sbindir='${exec_prefix}'/${PWD##*/}
     make

   You can now run fetchipac and ipacsum by calling them via 
   "./fetchipac" and "./ipacsum" respectively.

   Note: This is also a good way of debugging fetchipac because the binary
         will not be "stripped" this way.
