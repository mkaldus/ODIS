Subject: Re[2]: IPAC contrution: using IPAC and MRTG

Hello Moritz,

Yes, you're right :)

How it works:
Mrtg reads its own configuration file, specified by line in crontab
(look for mrtg manual page for details) and run specified in "target"
my program "ipaccount". It started with command line param - regexp
for search all ip-accounting chains (by call 'ipacsum' from ipac
package) and print found chain data in mrtg format. Mrtg give it and
write own graphs.

How I make it:
1. I install ipac and mrtg packages and add "/usr/local/bin/ipacset"
to the end of my rc.firewall script (ipac is good - it is not destroy
my own firewall rules, so it is safe).

2. I write ipac.conf file (example added) with all my-need accounting
chains. Look for chain names - this will be use in regexps later, so
select it carefully.

3. I write mrtg.conf (example added). In "target" field I call
"ipaccount" in "/usr/lib/mrtg/ipaccount 15m all" - is "get data from
chain 'all' for last 15 minutes '15m'" - because my MRTG called every
15 minutes in my crontab.

4. I test my system by manually call this MRTG string - it must print
two or more (up to 4) numbers with first is incoming traffic, and
second - outgoing.

5. I wait 15 minutes and look to MRTG generated pages. If some
troubles here - 99% that trouble is in mrtg or ipac configuration, so
see depended manual pages and FAQs.

That's all :)
