> ipac.cgi

ipac.cgi is a cgi script by Dan Swan <swan_daniel@hotmail.com>. It is
meat to be used as a front end to ipacsum and will generate the ipac
images and index.html page just in time. The page itself is generated
as normal files, and the browser is redirected to the generated page.

Dan said that there is still a problem concerning refresh of the images -
some browsers do not refresh images although you hit the refresh button,
and it seems the HTTP Expires: header line which is used through the
.asis file mechanism (see ipacsum(8)) does not help at least some times.

However, as he says, the script is functional.



> ipac_and_mrtg

This directory contains a script, a REAMDE and some example files written
by Tim Yunaev <tim@lviv.gu.net>. It makes mrtg display data which was
collected by ipac. mrtg - which had at least be an inspiration for ipac -
can be found at 
http://ee-staff.ethz.ch/~oetiker/webtools/mrtg/mrtg.html .



> suse_rpm

contains files needed to make rpm files for Suse Linux. So long, this
does not work automatically - you still need to place the files into
the proper places before calling rpm -ba.
