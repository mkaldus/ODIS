addmysql for ipac-ng Version Alpha 3

					Germany, 24.10.2004

written by Robert

This Script wants to create the neccessary MySQL entries that are needed for ipac-ng to work properly.
It takes several arguments, get a full list with "addsql --help"

It's a very early Version,

TEST IT AT YOUR OWN RISK!

I tested it with ipac-ng Version 1.31 and MySQL mysql-3.23.44, yeah it IS really old, I'll upgrade when I've got time.

Features:

Alpha 3:

-wants to be Newbie friendly, needs no arguments to create a full functional DB
-Creates a User in MySQL, a Database and a table in ipac-ng scheme
-tries to set up the Config for mysql and the given User, DB and password
-has a Reverse function that reverses (deletes) the given values and puts the old Config back
