How to use Robert's sqladd Script:

if you are unexperienced, use a local Database and use a Default Install of MySQL with no password for root, you could simply run "./addsql --add" and the entries and config Options will be set.
  In such a case it could be helpful to set the "bind  =  localhost" directive in the mysqld section of your my.cnf.

if you are more experienced and would like to specifiy things, try "./addsql --help"
if you are experienced and ask yourself "why"  go away :-P
