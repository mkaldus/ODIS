known problem(s):
    * ipactest script reports errors despite everything is 
      working ok - no fix yet
    * duplicate tickmarks in generated images can happen, this 
      is caused by rounding - no fix yet
    * with storage backend "gdbm" DO NOT call fetchipac twice in the 
      same second or your database will be destroyed - no fix, other than
      removing support for gdbm, yet
    * incorrect parsing of port ranges (port:port) in rules file.
    * if source/destination in rules file is specified as hostname,
      and this hostname resolves to multiple ip addresses, the rule
      is not accepted.
    * error message doesn't contain rule name if rule parsing error occurs

1.34.2
- fixed incompatibility with iptables 1.4.11 - 1.4.12.1 (sm)
- improved configure/build scripts. Now both dynamic (with iptables dynamic
  libraries) and static (with iptables source) compilation is compatible
  with iptables 1.4.3 - 1.4.12.1 (sm)
- updated documentation (sm)

1.34.1
- fixed incompatibility with some linux distributions which use iptables 1.4.10
  and later. Confirmed ability to work with iptables 1.4.3 - 1.4.11.1 (with shared
  iptables libraries, libxtables.so, libiptc.so and libip4tc.so). Static compilation
  works only with iptables version up to 1.4.9.1, and not in all linux distributions 
  (due to patched header files) (sm)

1.34
- ported to iptables 1.4.9.1, works with iptables 1.4.3 - 1.4.9.1, and maybe later (sm)
- removed a lot of unused code from iptables.c (sm)
- removed xtables.c, libiptc.c, libip4tc.c and corresponding header files,
  but instead added dependency on iptables libraries: libxtables.so and libiptc.so (sm)
- added option to configure script: "--with-iptables-src=" which allows to compile
  fetchipac statically with iptables source code (as it was in previous versions) (sm)
- added ipacsumdaily/monthly perl scripts to contrib directory (sm)
- updated documentation (sm)

1.33
- ported to iptables 1.4.2 (mdw21)

1.32
- added new options "--png-sort-by-bytes" and "--png-sort-by-pkts" (friedl/xavier)
- invmatch patch added to contrib (friedl/Afanasyev Nikolay)
- addsql alpha added to contrib (friedl/Robert Evert)

1.31
- force -H/-hostname when -r/--replace is used as option to ipacsum (friedl/Mark Wormgoor)
- mysql with fixed when port not specified in ipac.conf (friedl)
- documented the fact that '_' breaks configfile parser and is therefore
  not allowed in the database connection information (friedl)
- improved upgrade procedure for version<1.27 (friedl)
- mysql table definition file added to doc/ (friedl)
- added patch to fix problem in ipacsum with big numbers (friedl + Jason Hudgins)
- added mysql support (friedl/Denis O.Philippov)
- changed some error messages to be different when they apply 
  in different situations

1.30
- fixed a bug when running "fetchipac -Svv" (friedl)
- fixed the "%chain% name" chain creation bug (friedl)
- improve checking of storage backend libraries and error reporting 
  when not found (friedl)
- fixed an obviously very old bug in combination with an unusual 
  installation of the postgres include files (friedl)

1.29
- in case of the sqlite database the database file will be placed at 
  /var/lib/ipac with the selected database name plus the suffix ".db" (friedl)
- added support for the sqlite database backend (friedl/Simon Hausman)
- factor out common code for all sql backends (friedl + Simon Hausman)

1.28
- fixed the unspooling problem that creeped in during 1.28 (friedl)
- non classic mode removed
- make ipac-ng compile on 64 bit, also checked gdbm storage (friedl/Thomas Zehetbauer)
- put some documentation together in the doc/ subdirectory (friedl)
- the never documented webinterface is gone now (kaiser13, friedl)
- reduce worst case memory usage with huge database of >= 4GB to about 1.2GB (friedl)
- logging of database debug messages improved (friedl)
- add option '--enable-debug-database' to configure (friedl)
- add option '--human-kilo' to ipacsum, the default now is 1K=1024 (friedl)
- make it compile with older gcc's, move variable declarations
  to the start of the function (friedl)
- make INSTALLPATH completely controllable by configure, no
  hardcoded prefix/sbin anymore (friedl)
- memory appetite of fetchipac reduced greatly
- bigint changed to int in sql
- storage/postgre/postgre.c results from all PQexec's is now handled
- contrib/sample_configs/ipac.conf small documentation changes (friedl)
- storage/postgre/postgre.c possible logging bug fixed (friedl)
- storage/postgre/postgre.c reformated (friedl)
- storage/postgre/postgre.c added some errorhandling
- implemented support of iptables extensions
- removed old options from ./configure
- ipac-convert now installs correctly
- make clean was fixed to remove all binary files
- configure fails in case no bison or flex found
- new rules file parser
- new rules file format introduced

1.27
- compile problem with no postgresql has been fixed
- gdbm storage problem introduced in 1.26 has been fixed
- default config file has been corrected

1.26
- added support for multiple accounting hosts (see -H options to fetchipac and ipacsum)
- fetching speedup
- new word 'hostname' in config
- access agent name 'postg' changed to 'postgre'
- old configs samples were removed
- minor changes in database structure (read UPDATE-1.26)
- postgre is now the recommended storage

1.25
- batchmode was fixed again
- added ipac-2-mrtg contrib section
- compile problems with gcc 3.2 were solved
- runfile parsing with ipchains has been fixed
- other little fixes
