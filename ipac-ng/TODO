Things to do for ipac-ng 2.0 and beyond:

- complete rewrite :(

- implement support for iproute2 (maybe) (not now :)

- update documentation (partially done)

- 'reorganize' option to fetchipac which calls a corresponding function
  in the storage backend

- 'transaction' storage method API calls so using databases supporting 
  transactions will almost guarantee to keep accurate and consistent
  data

- make up a way to pass command line options to storage method backends
  (for example, a remote database server's host name and login info)

- write documentation on how to create a new storage method

- create documentation document with plain-file storage method 
  description

- implement support for ipv6

- create frontend GUI application

- create RPM/DEB packages for most popular Linux distributions
